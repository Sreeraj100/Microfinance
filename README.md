## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine before proceeding:

| Requirement                         | Minimum Version | Notes                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)      | 18 LTS          | Includes npm                                  |
| [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) | 6.x             | Local instance **or** a MongoDB Atlas cluster |
| npm                                 | 9+              | Comes with Node.js                            |

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/microfinance.git
cd microfinance
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
```

Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp env.example.txt .env
```

Edit `.env` — see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for details.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../Frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Running in Development

Open **two terminals**:

**Terminal 1 — Backend (API server on port 4000)**

```bash
cd Backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend (Vite dev server on port 5173)**

```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

> **Tip:** The Vite dev server is pre-configured to proxy `/api` requests to `http://localhost:4000`, so no cross-origin issues occur during development.

### 5. Production Build

Build the React app and copy the output into the backend's `dist/` folder so Express can serve it:

```bash
# From the Frontend directory
cd Frontend
npm run build

# Copy the build output to the backend
cp -r dist ../Backend/dist
```

Then start the production server:

```bash
cd ../Backend
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `Backend/` directory based on `env.example.txt`:

```dotenv
# Server
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development          # "production" for live deployments

# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/microfinance

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_secret_key_here

# Seed admin credentials (used only when no admin exists in the DB)
ADMIN_NAME=Admin
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin@1234
```

| Variable         | Required | Description                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`           | Optional | HTTP port the server listens on. Defaults to `4000`.                       |
| `MONGO_URI`      | **Yes**  | MongoDB connection string.                                                 |
| `JWT_SECRET`     | **Yes**  | Secret key for signing JWT tokens. Use a long random string in production. |

## Usage

### Admin Workflow

1. Log in with the admin credentials defined in your `.env` file.
2. Navigate to **Manage Users** to register new members.
3. Use **Manage Savings** to record deposits and withdrawals.
4. Use **Manage Loans** to disburse loans and record repayments.
5. Use **Manage Attendance** to mark member presence and manage fines.
6. Visit **Dashboard** for a high-level summary of all operations.

### User Workflow

2. Log in to access your personal **Dashboard**.
3. Browse **My Savings**, **My Loans**, and **My Attendance** for a full history of your account.

### API Quick Reference

## Configuration

### Vite Proxy (Frontend)

The Vite dev server proxies API calls so you do not need to hard-code `localhost:4000` in your React code. This is configured in [`Frontend/vite.config.js`](Frontend/vite.config.js):

```js
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': 'http://localhost:4000'
  }
}
```

### Interest Cron Job

The automated interest scheduler runs daily at midnight (server time). It applies **1 % interest** to the outstanding loan balance of every member who has not received an interest charge in the last **28 days**. No configuration is required — it starts automatically when the backend server starts. The logic lives in [`Backend/src/utils/interestCron.js`](Backend/src/utils/interestCron.js).

### CORS

CORS is currently configured to allow all origins (`"*"`). For production deployments, restrict this to your actual frontend domain in [`Backend/src/app.js`](Backend/src/app.js):

```js
app.use(cors({ origin: "https://your-production-domain.com" }));
```
