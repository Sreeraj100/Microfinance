 * SavingsPayment — records each weekly savings deposit for a user.
 *
 * The admin enters:
 *   - amount   → variable amount saved this week
 *   - paidOn   → date the payment was made
 *   - weekStartDate → normalized to start of the week (for deduplication)
 *
 * Derived values (computed in controller):
 *   - totalSavings          = sum of all amounts for this user
 *   - savingsInterest       = totalSavings × 0.01 (admin-only view)
 *   - currentWeekPaid       = whether a record exists for current week
